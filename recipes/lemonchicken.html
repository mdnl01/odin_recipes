    <h1>LEMON CHICKEN RECIPE</h1>
    <img src="/recipes/img/lemonchicken.jpg" alt="LEMON CHICKEN IMAGE">
    <h3>We love lemon-pepper wings,
        especially during football season.
        I got tired of spending so much money on them that I decided to whip up my own version of Wingstop's lemon-pepper chicken wings.
        The end result was an empty platter and pleased bellies.</h3>
    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups oil, or as needed</li>
            <li>  2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon-pepper seasoning</li>
            <li>12 chicken wings</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>STEPS</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Stir olive oil and lemon-pepper seasoning together in a bowl; set aside.</li>
            <li>Fry wings in hot oil until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 8 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C)</li>
            <li>Toss hot wings with lemon-pepper mixture to coat.</li>
        </ol>
